**Hero section slider:** A dynamic slider is featured in the hero section to display key products or promotions.</br>
**Product filtering:** Users can filter the furniture collection based on categories or other criteria, enhancing the browsing experience.</br>
**Multiple pages:** The site features multiple pages, allowing for seamless navigation and exploration of the full product range.</br>

This project is focused on presenting a complete furniture catalog with clean navigation and intuitive product filtering.
